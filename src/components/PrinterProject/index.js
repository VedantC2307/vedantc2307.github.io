        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          As part of my final year internship, I had the unique opportunity to design and build a 3D printer from scratch. It was an engaging and challenging project that allowed me to apply the basic principles of mechanical and electrical engineering, software, product development and project management.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Throughout the project, I gained invaluable experience in designing complex mechanical systems, understanding electrical circuits and components, and learning software to control the printer's movements. It also helped me practice time management, working to tight deadlines, and effective communication with colleagues and suppliers. These skills proved to be very useful in my future career as I was able to apply them to various projects in my job.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Assembling the printer was a meticulous process that required me to pay close attention to detail and apply my problem-solving ability to overcome various challenges along the way. However, the end result was worth the effort - a fully functional 3D printer that exceeded my expectations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          This project taught me a great deal about the basic principles of engineering and project management, and it provided me with a unique opportunity to apply these principles in a practical setting. I'm excited to showcase this project on my portfolio website and share the skills and expertise I gained throughout the process.

                I utilized SolidWorks to craft a detailed 3D model for my printer. This powerful tool facilitated meticulous design adjustments, ensuring perfect component integration and flawless motion testing. The outcome was a precise and functional blueprint guiding the successful real-world construction of my 3D printer.

                Following the SolidWorks design finalization, I meticulously compiled a comprehensive bill of materials (BOM). 
                This included structural frame elements such as the frame, linear rails, and belt drives, alongside electrical components 
                like stepper motors, drivers, SMPS, RAMPS 1.4, and Arduino Mega microcontroller. Through research and supplier comparisons, 
                top-quality components were secured at cost-effective rates.

                I meticulously assembled the 3D printer, starting with the frame, linear rails, and belt drives. Employing principles for proper motor positioning and belt tensioning ensured smooth operation while minimizing backlash. For electronics, I carefully wired the stepper motors, endstops, and hotend to the RAMPS board and tuned the stepper drivers. After flashing Marlin firmware with custom configurations, extensive calibration followedâ€”adjusting steps/mm for precise movement, leveling the bed, and fine-tuning extrusion parameters. This methodical approach culminated in a 3D printer delivering accurate, high-quality prints.
